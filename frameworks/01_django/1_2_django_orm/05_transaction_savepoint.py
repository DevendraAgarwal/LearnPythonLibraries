Transaction

transaction.atomic ensures that a block of code is executed within a 
database transaction. If any part of the block fails, the entire transaction 
is rolled back.

SavePoint

Djangoâ€™s transaction management also supports savepoints, which are intermediate 
points within a transaction that can be rolled back to without rolling back the 
entire transaction.
